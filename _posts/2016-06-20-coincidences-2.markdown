It happened again. 
A few days back I read an essay at *3AMmagazine* by Mark Amerika about how he wrote his book *Locus Solus*, a process that involved online translating machines, a text in French by a writer I have never heard of before - Raymond Roussel and remixing the translated text into a new narrative. I got interested and read a little bit about the French author and I was surprised to find him a rather peculiar figure. 
This morning, in the underground, on my way to work, I continued reading from Luiselli's *Story of my Teeth* and, low and behold, there he is, Mr. Roussel! Actually, one of his teeth was being auctioned in the Hyperbolic Lot Nr. 10 by another peculiar figure, Mr. Gustavo (Highway) Sánchez Sánchez!
