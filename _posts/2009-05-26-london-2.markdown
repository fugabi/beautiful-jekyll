Busy, busy…

London was great.

I find it very good that entrance to all important museums is free (for the permanent collections, anyway). It is good to know that whenever I want I can go to the National Gallery and spend a few hours in front of the impressionists (for example) or to Tate to see Turner or wherever/whatever.

Fish and Chips (of course!)

Scones, cream and my choice of preserve at Patisserie Valerie.

Guiness, Guiness Red, Smithwicks, Youngs, Ginger Beer, Albana di Romana ([Locanda Locatelli](http://www.locandalocatelli.com/web/home.aspx)).

Indian – Diwana, The Famous Lily Tandoori, Locanda, Wagamama, My Village (Camden Market) a couple of pubs.

[The Playhouse – La Cage aux Folles](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/la-cage-aux-folles-playhouse-theatre-london-986200.html).

Shopping at [Muji](http://www.muji.com/), the minimalist Japanese.

[Kew Gardens](http://www.kew.org/) – spent a few hours there, took hundreds of photos and walked and walked and walked.

Museums:

Tate Britain / Tate Modern / National Gallery / British Museum / Photography Gallery / Barbican Center

Design Museum – somewhat of a letdown. Most of the things on display there I already knew about (I don’t waste my time checking so many RSS feeds daily after all) and, actually, there was too little to see for almost 10 pounds.

Christie’s/Sotheby’s/Bonhams – not much to see here either. Just between sales or displaying second rate stuff. Pity. The Japanese stuff at Sothebys was actually quite nice. But I just wanted to see where they are and go around a bit.
