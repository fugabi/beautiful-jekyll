Have a lookÂ [here](http://www.cameratruck.net/). This is the biggest and simplest camera in the whole world. Look at the pictures in the gallery. And, of course, zoom in! More and more! The photos seem to never end. And they continue to be sharp and clear. And notice the handwork. The sponge traces. This is actually a camera obscura on wheels.
