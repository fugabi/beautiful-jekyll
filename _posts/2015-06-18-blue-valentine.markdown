Not a bad movie. It might have been a beautiful love story. It could have been shorter and it would have had an uplifting story about how two very different people meet, have fun, fall in love, stay together. But the director, it seems, had something else in mind. The story had to go further. It had to land on the rocky shore of disillusion. 

After the movie, I tried to find the *You and Me* song. Their song. Was not very successful but I stumbled upon Zee Avi and since then I keep listening to her *Concrete Wall*. 
And listened and listened and listened... I even listen to it now. Don't know why exactly. It is simple, airy, sounds sweet but it is not. Actually, a perfect fit for a Blue Valentine.
