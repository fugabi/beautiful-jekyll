A new exhibition opened last week at MUMOK – Cy Twombly which I intend to see. I went there for the opening (which took place outside in MQ) but then, when I saw how many people already gathered, I gave up. Just stayed a bit and took some photos. Will do the seeing soon.

Now, photos – although chunky and not light, I do take the A200 everywhere and cannot stop marveling at the photos it can take. Of course, without the right lenses, it would not be much to talk about. I am quite impressed and I do not ever want to go back to point & shoot cameras.
