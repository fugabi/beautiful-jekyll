All I need is somebody to love me like you do.  
To give me back to myself.  
To scrawl ***[I Love You](http://www.radiolab.org/story/110206-finding-emilie/)*** on my left palm.  
While I wander, blind and frightened, over and above us all.  
All I need is a hammer  
of sound  
and a furnace  
of light.  
I'll forge my world  
shriveled of foot  
tongs on anvil
