This is the world of a philosophy graduate, who happens to work with old paintings, who invents all sorts of memories and tries to overcome his limitations (as far as he's aware of them) through writing.

**CENTO**

PRONUNCIATION:
(SEN-to) 

MEANING:
noun: A literary work, especially a poem, composed of parts taken from works of other authors.

ETYMOLOGY:
From Latin cento (patchwork). Earliest documented use: 1605


NOTES:
Nobel-prize-winning poet T.S. Eliot’s observation is relevant to centos: “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion.”

Examples of centos:
The Oxford Cento by David Lehman
The Dong With the Luminous Nose by John Ashbery

USAGE:
“Louis Zukofsky continued to write ... a play, a novella, a book of criticism, a 500-page cento of philosophy in homage to Shakespeare ...”
Bob Perelman; Finding His Voice; Tikkun (Berkeley, California); May/Jun 2007.
