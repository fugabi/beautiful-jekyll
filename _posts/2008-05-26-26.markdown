[Early color photography](http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/06/15961.html) made with potatoe... dust.

And then some [stellar dust](http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/07/eye-on-the-universe.html).

[Bruce Gilden](http://www.magnumphotos.com/Archive/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.PhotographerDetail_VPage&l1=0&pid=2K7O3R1482X4&nm=Bruce Gilden) 
and a small [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkIWW6vwrvM&hl=en&rel=0) with/about him.

And [Albert Kahn](http://www.albertkahn.co.uk/index.html). That was quite a feat....
