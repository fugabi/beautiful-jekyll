What did I say? If you need good old plain storytelling, you go to Auster. He never fails you. The Brooklyn Follies is good to read. Despite the fact that Nathan sounds more than often a bit too all-knowing (although Auster tries to hide that by sometimes making him begin with the improbable and then deny it) and that the stories cling to each other a bit too perfectly, it is a good read. I like his NE American English and I like his ruminations. Learned some stuff about American literature (the discussion about Poe and Thoreau was illuminating), about life in Brooklyn but most of all I enjoyed the stories. I knew some of them already, I cannot remember from where though – but I know about the project he had – recording coincidences – and perhaps that’s how I got to know them. Nevermind!
