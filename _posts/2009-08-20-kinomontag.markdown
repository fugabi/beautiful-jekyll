**Il Divo**. In Italian with German subtitles. Made me spend some time on the internet reading about the recent Italian history. Was this a good movie? Donâ€™t really know. It happened a lot in it but it did not really have a plot line. I mean like a story with a beginning, middle and an end. Lots of characters have been introduced at a very quick pace. Some of them have been subsequently left to drift aside. But it was engaging and had a rather funny photography. Lots of red. Funky music ([check the soundtrack!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023490/soundtrack)). And the legendary [Andreotti quotes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023490/quotes) shined like diamonds on the background of the dark interiors where most of the action took place or through that red Sicilian dust.
