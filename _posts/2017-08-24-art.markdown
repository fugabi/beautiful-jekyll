On [Bookworm](https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/bookworm), last night, I've had the chance to hear a new name which, I think, will preoccupy me for a while in the next time. Walter Hopps. *Dream Colony* is a book about him written by the fiction editor of *The New Yorker*, Deborah Treisman. 
And now the thing that incited me: Hopps - "art offers the possibility of love with strangers."  
That would explain something about myself.
