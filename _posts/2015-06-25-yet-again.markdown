Intellectually idle for the time being. Not doing any writing, no translations, not much reading. At least I try to keep going for a run every other day. 

But I spend as much time I have with R. I think we have a good relationship and I also think treating him like an adult who should still be able to enjoy his childhood as much as he can is the right way to do it. I try to avoid conflicts, sometimes a little bit too much. It takes time, indeed, but I have the feeling that's the way to go. I do not like bad blood between us because I don't think it leads anywhere. I do not want him to find refuge only within himself. We are here for him too, even when there are differences. In a few years there will be a gap between us, he'll have his peers, his buddies and he'll spend more time and thoughts with them than with us anyway.
