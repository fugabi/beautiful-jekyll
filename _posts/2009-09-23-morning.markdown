After teaching, I went to the gallery on foot. It was such a lovely morning! Memories of last night’s opulent dinner and fun, combined with the beautiful light and the fresh air, with the laughing of kids in the park, with the taste of a fresh French croissant… And a bit of music…

I really like Vienna!
