everyone in the underground looks tired this rainy evening. two men next to me talk about photography. or that’s what i think they discuss — i can’t hear them well enough. _exposure_ comes up, as well as _light_. one of them has a DSLR hanging around his neck, his right hand holding it carefully. am thinking about their hobby and about the thousands upon thousands of pictures nobody will ever get to see. are they good enough? powerful enough? is there enough light in them? enough negative space? does it matter if nobody will ever look at them? will they ever be “discovered”?   

somehow the topic seems to have changed and one of them says:  
“if you go on a pilgrimage you have to feel pain. if you don’t feel pain, a pilgrimage is of no use.”
