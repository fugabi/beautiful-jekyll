I did quite a lot of reading on the new **P**ersonal **R**eading **S**ystem (Sony PRS700): 

Mark Haddon – [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night-time), which is quite easy to read. Somehow simple and complicated at the same time. Simple because it is narrated by someone who needs to have it simple in order to be able to let it out. And complicated because it goes into such details at times which the narrator also needs in order to understand the world. Meet Christopher Boone, an autistic teenager. The only thing this book lacks is feeling. There is no gasping, the heart does not spark. But the brain is always there.

Marquez – [Memories of My Melancholy Whores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memories_of_My_Melancholy_Whores). It’s a Marquez so one should know what to expect. And, I could follow up on the Picasso exhibition I wrote about [earlier](http://wpgf.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/too-loud-a-solitude-minotaurs/). The 90 year old minotaur… Just to have a taste of it: 

  “Damn it, I thought, blushing is so disloyal.”

“Blood circulated through her veins with the fluidity of a song that branched off into the most hidden areas of her body and returned to her heart, purified by love.”

“I discovered that I am not disciplined out of virtue but as a reaction to my negligence, that I appear generous in order to conceal my meanness, that I passed myself off as prudent because I am evil-minded, that I am conciliatory in order not to succumb to my repressed rage, that I am punctual only to hide how little I care about other people’s time.”
