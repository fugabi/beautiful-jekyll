Sometimes he scares me.  
The whiteness of his ghostly skin,  
his crocus eyes,  
his lily mouth...  


He's but a child who  
wants his world not taller  
than his highness,  
not wider than his pony.  


A small plebeian spook,  
apple in hand and fear  
around my neck - his jester queen,  


that's what I am today.   


He chose me with a wink,  

a glint of sun fleeing his eye.  


But when he kips  
I pinch his nose and  
bite his little finger.
