I speak to him in an old  
language,  
musty and inveterate,  
with a faint  
whiff of salty cheese  
and home-made bread.  
  
Here, dragons  
have only four letters,  
cars are  
complicated machinery  
and polenta  
is made up of eMs.  
  
Here, to be  
is thinner than  
a spider’s thread.  

I let him have it,  
this language  
of mine,  
one word  
at a time:  
medicine for an illness  
to come.  
  
Curled up in his bed,  
sleepy,  
he asks for a story.  
  
His fingers  
follow obscure trails  
along my scalp.  
  
“A story from here”,  
he tells me  
“in your tongue.”
