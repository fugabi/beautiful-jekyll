in a jiffy, elbowing my way around the sculptures, i managed to see yesterday’s [opening](http://www.leopoldmuseum.org/ausstellungen/) at leopold museum. at the beginning i took refuge in the small theater which was almost empty and saw there a documentary on [ernst barlach](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Barlach). and then had to fight my way through the masses and saw the sculptures ([käthe kollwitz](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Käthe_Kollwitz) included), drawings, etchings and lithographs which were exhibited. overall, you get a feeling of gloom and unsettling – death, fear, unhappiness. it’s been interesting to see how much influence his trip to russia had on his work. or his interest in far-eastern philosophy ([der berserker](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Ernst_Barlach_Der_Berserker_1910_Nussbaum-1.jpg&filetimestamp=20090101174648)). and how he abandoned everything after his work has been categorized as degenerate art, his ‘angel’ being destroyed…
