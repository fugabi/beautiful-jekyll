I’ve only read half of The Sun Also Rises but I think  I can somehow spot the Americanness of Hemingway. Yes, I did not read any Hemingway until now but I got a whole collection with most of his books and I do intend to read them (all). After half of the book the intrigue just starts to unveil (at least, that’s what I think he’s pointing to). There are lots of dialogues in there and rather little analysis thus far. Yes, I know he’s not a judge (H) and never will be. Perhaps that’s why he’s so appreciated. Am curious what the rest is going to bring.

In the underground – listened to Sophocle’s Antigone.
