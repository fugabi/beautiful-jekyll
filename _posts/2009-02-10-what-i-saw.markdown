two exhibitions. i caught both of them in their last week. 

[**peter kogler**](http://www.kogler.net/index.php) – in MUMOK. check [this ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiSac27C-Hg)out. and try to imagine being there, alone. just you and the projection. and the sound blasting out from huge speakers, camouflaged behind the walls. 

[**edward hopper**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper) – in kunsthalle. it somehow resonated with the book i was reading at the time – survivor. eerie. black. uncanny. hopper’s work is not overwhelming in this exhibition. there are some 15-20 paintings/drawings by him. the rest – jim jarmusch, jonas dahlberg, tim eitel, jeff wall, etc. of course, there is always pleasure involved in seeing a jeff wall. or a jarmusch. or something new, that i did not see before. 

[**jonas dahlberg**](http://www.jonasdahlberg.com/). open the "melting" movies and let them play simultaneously. watch them! there is such a different take on destruction in these movies. almost sweet and playful. but destruction nevertheless.
