The kid is riding another _Star Wars_ wave these days. They come and go, these waves, feeding on the colorful books he collected, detailing the multitude of future, non-existent worlds. He tells me about what kind of beings or robots are better suited for what kind of jobs, how their tools or weapons could be improved, or how they could be rendered useless.  
Then he goes around, hands cupped over his mouth, and does the well-known breathing noise. He puts his body in different positions trying to catch a change in the whizzing.  
Then he stops suddenly and asks confused:  

“But—  how does he sneeze?”  

How does he, indeed? How does he even catch a cold? How does he feel at all, under all that armor, shrouded in black?   
How would a virtual sneeze coming from a dark antagonistic _Vader_ sound like?
