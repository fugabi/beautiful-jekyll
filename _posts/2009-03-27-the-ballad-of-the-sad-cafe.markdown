After Borges I read a bit from **Anna Sam**’s hyped *Leiden einer Kassiererin*. Read about 50 pages in an hour or so. Quite a change of direction, ain’t it? I interrupted it and started *The Ballad of the Sad Café*, by **Carson McCullers**. I bought this book at a flea market down the street. Yesterday evening I finished the main story, the one that gives the title to the book. And I liked it very much! It reminds me of Green or Faulkner (with regard to style). It was my first encounter with McCullers and I think I will read on. Miss Amelia, Marvin Macy and the Hunchback will give me more occasions to think about them. The story goes slowly towards its climax and, once reached, it drops down pretty fast and leaves you hanging, thinking, trying to figure out why it happened the way it did. Not an easy one! 

This weekend I’ll be done with it. The other stories will be read in a jiffy. And I am already waiting impatiently to receiving the other books I ordered – Calvino, Cortazar, Hrabal… And next, I will have to buy Walt Whitman. I saw a short movie about him (from PBS) and now I really want to read his verses. The trouble is, the book should be pretty thick. Perhaps save it for an ebook reader (whenever that will come; if at all).
