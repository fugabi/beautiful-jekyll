dSLR fever. A world I just became aware of and now I try to get to know more about it. Reading articles and reviews, watching pictures over pictures over pictures and trying to guess the kind of lenses being used. There is so much to learn! And so much to bring out with the right tools. A new way of being creative. I will certainly have to try it. Perhaps tomorrowâ€¦ or the day after. [Alpha 200](http://www.sony.net/Products/dslr/a200/features.html) with the old Minolta lenses. Cannot wait!

But you know what this means? This means even less writing and even less concentration at work. And I assume it will take a couple of weeks until I will calm down a bit. But I have to try it!

Where does time fly?
