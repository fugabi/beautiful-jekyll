was in a tram last night, going home. at one station, a bunch of French seniors got in; 20-30 of them. all smiling and shouting "Dominique," for some reason. when the tram departed, rather abruptly, they all let out a"whoosh" sound while being catapulted about a meter towards the back, forming a solid mass of happy people: they kept laughing and shrieking. we rode together for a while. 
"Dominique! A la prochene!" called a voice and at the next stop they all disappeared and silence set in again.
