Iran – [Where is my vote?](http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/iranelect_06_22/i33_19435763.jpg) series…

It [rains since yesterday morning](http://derstandard.at/fs/r1245670048301/Regenwetter). Continuously… I want it to stop!

Stop!

Stop!

Where is sun? The summer heat?

Yesterday we saw [Il Pranzo di Ferragosto](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1277728/). A funny little movie. At times, I found it a bit too crammed (camera too close, a bit out of focus) but then again, this added to the overall impression. The small apartment, the heat of the city, the emptiness of the city on this holiday – all pretty nicely combined. Will we all be the same when we’ll be old?

I am already half way through Oblomov. I do not feel I will end up liking it, but there is still more to read… Let us see…

Mp3s of  [Weegee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weegee) and [Cartier-Bresson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartier-Bresson) at [bwf](http://boogiewoogieflu.blogspot.com/2009/06/weegee-speaks.html). Interesting to hear them talk about themselves and how they did their work.

Das Leben – ein Traum…

[Prokudin-Gorsky](http://www.socyberty.com/History/The-Incredible-Century-Old-Color-Photography-of-Prokudin-Gorsky.797569/1) beautiful photos from Russia, more than a century ago.
