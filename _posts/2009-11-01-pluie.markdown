[Parlez-moi de la pluie!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065332/)

Yes. 
Tell me about the rain. Actually, why is it called like this? According to Wikipedia, the screenwriter, director and actor Agnès Jaoui had a song in her ears when she was rushing to a writing session with her husband. *L’orage* by Georges Brassens. Which begins with *Parlez-moi de la pluie, et non pas du beau temps*. This is a good movie. Yesterday we walked through the city, had a coffee here, a drink there, talked with friends and then, in the evening decided to go to the movies. No reviews read, no idea about what plays where. Had a tour of the movie theaters near the city center and then decided on the one that started soonest. It was getting cold outside… And there it was… Parlez-moi de la pluie! Pretty much opposite of the song mentioned earlier, the movie has not the fury of a hurricane and the rain to be seen on the screen is rather *faible*. The characters… don’t know if there are any to be liked or to identify with. They are no heroes. Just normal, plausible people, doing normal, plausible things. The plot – not a big deal (apparently). Just a couple of guys making a documentary about successful women (apparently). And then, slowly, other things come up but the whole never becomes too complicated.

A bit of normal life. Which, although usually sunny, gets a few rainy days as well.
