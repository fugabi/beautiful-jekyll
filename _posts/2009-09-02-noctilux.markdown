What a nice name! A Leica lens. 50/0.95. Can you imagine that? I know there are some film lenses that go even wider than that. 0.7 – Kubrick – Barry Lyndon: most of the night scenes (candle light) were shot without extra light. And only a lens so fast could’ve done the job. Anyway, [click here to see some photos](http://www.flickriver.com/groups/63271221@N00/pool/interesting/) taken with it. The wonderful Bokeh, the slight vignetting, the perfect sharpness… And, by the way, it only costs a little over $ 10,000! Pipe dreams…
